To add a component to your project:

This will create a new component in your project's `src/components` directory. You can then import and use it:

```tsx
import { Button } from '@/components/button';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <Button 
      variant="primary" 
      size="md" 
      onPress={() => console.log('Pressed!')}
    >
      Click Me
    </Button>
  );
}
```

### Available Components

- Button
  - Variants: primary, secondary, outline, ghost
  - Sizes: sm, md, lg
  - Features: loading state, icons, disabled state

More components coming soon!

All components are copied into your project's source code, giving you full control to customize them. The components are built with:

- TypeScript for type safety
- Modern React Native practices
- Performance optimizations
- Accessibility support
